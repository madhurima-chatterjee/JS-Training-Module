# Use Case: Debug and handle API call failure
It simulates an API failure (404 error) and shows how to catch and display the error in a user-friendly way, while also logging useful details for developers.

> A user clicks a button to fetch data from an API, but the request fails (e.g., due to a 404 or network issue).  
> This example catches the failure, logs it for debugging, and displays a clear message in the UI.
