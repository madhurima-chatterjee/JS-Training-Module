# SELECTION STRUCTURES
1. IF: Runs a block of code only if a condition is true.
2. ELSE: Runs one block of code if the condition is true, another if it's false.
3. ELSE-IF: Checks multiple conditions, one after another.
4. SWITCH: Used when you have many conditions based on one variable or expression.
    break - stops the code from falling through to the next case.
    default - runs if none of the cases match.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ITERATIVE STRUCTURES
1. FOR LOOP: Runs the code a specific number of times.
2. WHILE LOOP: Runs the code as long as the condition is true.
    Use when you donâ€™t know exactly how many times to loop ahead of time.
3. DO WHILE: Like while, but it runs at least once, even if the condition is false at first.
4. FOR OF LOOP: for strings.
5. FOR IN LOOP: for objects.
